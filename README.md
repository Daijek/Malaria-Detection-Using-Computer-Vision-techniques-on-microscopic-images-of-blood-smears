# Malaria-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision-techniques-on-microscopic-images-of-blood-smears
## Overview
<p>
  Research to determine if some unexplored approaches can produce state-of-the-art results in detecting malaria from microscopic images of blood smears. Please see the project report for detailed objectives
</p>
<ul>
  <li>	Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a hybrid CNN including a CNN support Vector Machine(SVM) and a CNN random forest(RF) to find out if traditional machine models trained on features extracted from CNNs would lead to state-of-the-art results in Malaria detection.</li>
  <li>Determined that the CNN-RF had better results than several pre-existing models used for the task, including InceptionV3, ResNet101V2, VGG-16, and VGG-19, with an accuracy of 97.34%, F1-score of 97.38%, Recall of 97.34%, and precision of 97.35%.</li>
